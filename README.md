# DCIT 50 – Java Programming Laboratory Portfolio

This repository contains a compilation of all laboratory activities completed for the subject **DCIT 50**. The activities are designed to demonstrate fundamental Java programming concepts through practical, problem-based applications.

Each laboratory activity is organized in a **separate folder** and focuses on different aspects of Java development, including basic syntax, control structures, arrays, and object-oriented programming principles. The projects emphasize proper program logic, code organization, and user interaction using console-based applications.

This portfolio serves as a consolidated reference of my progress and learning throughout the course, showcasing how theoretical concepts were applied to solve real-world programming problems.
